Auto commit

Mazipan's Github Stats

Make it your own
Create your own repo with click "Use this template" button (⚠️ forked repo will not work)
Or just do in the manual way:

✅ Create your own repo
✅ Copy file .github/workflows/autocommit.yml and LAST_UPDATED to your repo
✅ You have to configure your repository. Go to: Settings -> Action -> General -> Workflow permissions and choose "Read and write permissions"
✅ Change the email and name information on file autocommit.yml, line 29 and 30
✅ Change the scheduling time on file autocommit.yml, line 10. You can use crontab.guru if you are not familiar with the cron schedule string. For first time, you can try to run it in every hour with string 1 * * * * .
✅ Consider to support me, at least click the 🌟 button
